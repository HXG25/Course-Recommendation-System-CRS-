Course Recommendation System (CRS)

This project is a Course Recommendation System designed to help users discover courses that match their interests and learning goals.
The system analyzes user preferences, course content, and similarity patterns to recommend the most relevant courses.


🎯 Objective
To enhance the learning experience by providing personalized course recommendations instead of showing the same course list to every user.


🔍 How It Works
The system collects or receives user interests (e.g., AI, Web Development, Networking).
It compares user preferences with course descriptions and metadata.
Using similarity scoring / machine learning, it recommends the most relevant courses.


🧠 Recommendation Techniques Used
Depending on your implementation:
Content-Based Filtering (recommends courses similar to what the user likes)
Collaborative Filtering (recommends based on similar users)
Cosine Similarity / TF-IDF for text-based matching
Matrix Factorization or Neural Networks (optional)


📊 Dataset
The dataset contains:
Course titles
Course descriptions
Category / domain (e.g., ML, Web, Cloud)
User interests or previous enrollment history
(If sourced from Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, or custom dataset, mention it here.)



🔧 Technologies Used
Component	Tools Used
Language	Python
Data Preprocessing	Pandas, NumPy
Feature Extraction	TF-IDF / CountVectorizer
ML/Similarity	Scikit-learn (Cosine Similarity)
UI (optional)	Streamlit, Flask
Version Control	Git + GitHub

📈 Output
The system recommends a ranked list of courses tailored to the user.
Helps learners save time and makes course discovery more efficient.
Example Output:
Recommended Courses:
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning Foundations
3. Data Analysis with Python


🚀 Future Enhancements
Add user feedback loop to improve recommendations
Deploy as a web app or mobile interface
Integrate real-time course APIs (Coursera, Udemy, EdX)
Add personalized difficulty-level suggestions
